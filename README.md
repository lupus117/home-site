# Sten Unt home site
Welcome to my home site, a lightwheight site cobbled together with pure html, js and css. 

My intentions were making this homey and reminicent of a homey desktop environment where you can view relevant data. 

## Technical details
This website is hosted on github pages. So it is statically hosted. Because I wanted to practice programming a little bit and didn't want to bother with Nodejs I made sure to avoid using modules and all that stuff.
